Hi, as you may already know my name is Antonio Hernandez.  I completed an intensive 6+ month program at Lambda School, learning how to work with
the current technologies in Machine Learning and Data Science.  In that program I had exposure to a lot of the common ML algorithms and various technologies
currently used.  Jupyter Notebooks, SQL, Python 3, Google's Colab, PySpark, Pandas, NLP libraries, PyTorch, Tensorflow, Data Vizualization libraries, and many others.  Now I did not become an expert at any of these, instead I obtained something I value much more from Lambda which is the ability to learn a technology on my own.  Learn enough to get results and if I become very interested go back and acquire deeper knowledge on the subject/technology.
