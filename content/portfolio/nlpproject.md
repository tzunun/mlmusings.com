In this project the main goal was to compare an applicant's resume to a job posting using machine learning techniques identify parts where the resume matches the job posting and find areas where the it needs attention.  

--Although the site is functional, it is mostly for demonstration purposes.  I worked on this project along with 3 engineers.

This graph is basically a representation of the job posting and the resume.
The dots (representing words) are initally assigned random coordinates, but dots that are closer to each other on the graph are closer in meaning or context.
